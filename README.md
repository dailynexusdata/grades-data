# Daily Nexus Grades Search Data Files

The published data includes the total number of students receiving each grade — before pass/fail and satisfactory/unsatisfactory conversions — for every course offered from Fall 2009 until Spring 2023. Instructors of optional-grading courses do not know what grading option students have selected, according to the Office of the Registrar. The data will be regularly updated on this website as new data arrives. All data is free to re-use.
